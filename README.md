<br>This is a modified app based an closed sources app, and I'm not the developer of that original app. Modifing apps by non profit purpose (assume you will delete it in 24 hrs) is legal in Chinese law. Please remember to refer to your local laws when using this app. And I an not responsible for any legal risks.</br>
<br>This app not supports Android 9.0 and above, considering this is an close sources modified app, I have no idea to fix this. Issues about compatibility is welcomed but I may have no ability to fix it. Thank you very much!
